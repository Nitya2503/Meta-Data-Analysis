-  📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
-  🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

Features

Business Problem:

There is no single, consolidated view of Facebook and Instagram ad performance, making it difficult to understand which campaigns, audience groups, countries, and ad formats are performing well. Due to scattered data, it becomes challenging to track engagement and conversion trends, optimize ad budgets, and identify areas where campaign performance is weak.

Goal of the Dashboard:

- To centralize Facebook & Instagram ad performance data into a single interactive view.
- To help stakeholders monitor impressions, clicks, CTR, engagements, conversions, and budget utilization.
- To provide demographic, geographic, and ad-type insights for more accurate campaign optimization.
- To enable time-based analysis (hourly, weekly, monthly) for performance patterns.

Business Impact & Key Insights:

1. Improved Ad Targeting
Demographic & gender-based impressions highlight the most responsive audience segments, helping teams refine their targeting strategies.
2. Optimized Budget Allocation
Budget & performance metrics reveal high-yield campaigns, enabling smarter budget distribution and reduction of wasted ad spend.
3. Enhanced Engagement Strategy
Breakdowns by ad type (Carousel, Video, Image, Stories) show which formats deliver stronger CTR, engagement rate, and conversion rate.
4. Better Regional Marketing Decisions
Country-wise impressions pinpoint high-potential geographic markets for campaign expansion.
5. Data-Driven Scheduling Decisions
Hourly & weekly trends reveal the best time slots for posting ads, boosting engagement and lowering cost per result.
6. Faster Performance Diagnosis
Central KPIs help quickly identify drops in impressions, clicks, or conversions, enabling immediate corrective actions.
